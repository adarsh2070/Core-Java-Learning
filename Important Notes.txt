Q1. The main method is mandatory in Java or not?

Before JDK 6 :

1.if we dont define main method then we can write our whole logic in Static block and it would run perfectly fine as static bloack loaded first in the memory.
2.after execting the static block the program goes to find main method and if it dont find then it will give exception while executing the main method
that main mathod is not found. 
3. we can use System.exit to get the exit code after static block.

After JDK 6 :
1. Main method is mandatory and if we dont define main method then it will give a error rather than exception as the code has not run yet.


Q2. Difference between error and exception is

Object :-> Throwable -> 1.Exception,2.Error 

Error->
1. Runtime
2. Compiler error
3. Logical Error

Exception-> 1. Checked Exception 2. Unchecked Exception
1. Runtime 

Errors -> Errors are conditions that cannot get recovered by any handling techniques. It surely causes termination of the program abnormally. Errors belong to unchecked type and mostly occur at runtime. 
Some of the examples of errors are Out of memory errors or System crash errors
